## About Mechanics of Material Defects

This course will guide you through the practical tools and background knowledge you will need as an experimentalist studying deformation features in crystalline materials, specifically those that are of interest in the deformation and mechanical properties of metals. This course puts particular focus on being able to connect illustrative models to how defects might look when observed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or transmission electron microscope (TEM). This is not a comprehensive overview of material defects nor of electron microscopy, but is instead an overview of materials defects for a first-year PhD student who will be studying characterization of deformation features in crystal structures. <small> I like to think of this as a crash course that I wish I had as a first-year PhD student </small>

We will do a quick overview of crystallographic structures including the Bravais lattices and slip systems as well as Schmid factor and slip trace analysis. Then we will take a detailed look at dislocations: how they form, move, and how to characterize them (theoretically and with electron microscopy). Finally, we will move onto higher dimensional defects including stacking faults, twins, and kink bands. At the end of this course, you will be able to identify deformation features based on electron microscope micrographs and supporting crystallographic information. Students will practice identification through journal club assignments where they will have to re-analyze data presented in papers and outline why the papers conclusions are justified or not given the available data.

### Learning Objectives
- Interpret unidentified defect structures in SEM and TEM micrographs
- Develop plans to determine which deformation features are present
- Evaluate claims that a paper makes about what deformation features are present
- Identify slip trace directions in an SEM image
- Classify a boundary as a grain boundary, kink band, or twin
- Determine if a dislocation is edge or screw
- Use a burgers circuit to find the burgers vector
- Relate deformation features to observed mechanical properties
- Predict mechanical behavior based on observed deformation features
- Assemble tools in your characterization "tool-box" for your structural materials research
- Formulate and/or use toy models to better understand your system and design experiments
- Reflect on the best ways to assess and question existing research
- Predict the tools you will need to answer your research questions
- Demonstrate thoughtful, critical, and respectful discussion with peers
- Write and Present research plans clearly and be able describe why this research is worth doing
- Appreciate situations where electron microscopy characterization techniques are useful with respect to defects and understand their limitations

### Muddy Cards
Every fourth class period of a unit will be "Muddy Card" Lecture, where discussed topics will include those proposed by students. 
Muddy cards can be written on paper in class the class period before the Muddy Card lecture or submitted on the [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEng4On_vTBiJOrDqG2SDDcL_zuXyBPXqYyA5Bf-nhGubWZA/viewform?usp=sharing) by midnight of the class period before the Muddy Card lecture.  Students should feel free to ask about topics not discussed in class on muddy cards, but questions on topics specifically covered in the course will take precedence. 

### Journal Clubs
Units 2, 3, and 4 will have a journal club assignment and class period:
The assigned reading for this class is the journal article. 

Journal Clubs consist of:
- reading the assigned primary research article
- Write up reasons why you agree or disagree with a specific conclusion based on the provided evidence
- Participate in structured discussion

#### Written Assignment guidelines
- Students will submit a peer-reviewed journal style "reviewer comments" which should include:
    - short 1 paragraph summary of the article
    - comments that focus on at least 3 conclusions made in the article 
- comments may be critical or complimentary of conclusions, but must reference how provided evidence (e.g. figures, tables, data) support the conclusions
- Specific assignments may include additional tasks (e.g. complete a figure annotation assignment)

## Classes, readings, nanoquizzes
### Class meetings
There will be two 1-hour class meetings each week on Tuesday and Thursday. You are expected to attend all class meetings and to participate actively in exercises and discussions. Students will be asked to complete an [attendance survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJnWPJ0A_OEj0P6cs-M_ymkh-M6pKHxvjmg-Utpel2d3Yd3g/viewform?usp=sharing) at the beginning of the course to make three attendance goals, which will factor into their final class work grade  
### Readings
Most classes will have a reading that you must read before coming to class, with online reading checks that you should do by 10pm the night before the class. The online exercises are designed to be practice for the in-class nanoquizzes, but are not graded for correctness, only for effort. 
### Nanoquizzes 
Every class meeting will begin with a short quiz on the required reading for the class, plus recent class meetings. Nanoquizzes are closed-book and closed-notes, with a 3-minute time limit. The nanoquiz is part of the grade for each class, along with reading exercises, in-class discussion, and other activities.

The lowest 5 classwork grades are automatically dropped, so you are automatically excused from up to five classes. You can also make up missed or low classwork grades. More info: details of classwork grading and makeup.

## Classwork Grading and Makeup

Each class meeting has a classwork grade out of 10 points, which combines:
exercises before class (e.g. reading questions), a nanoquiz at the start of class, and in-class discussions. You will be asked to set three participation goals for this class and your self assessment towards your goals will factor into your final classwork grade. 

Before-class work is graded based on whether you put effort into it, not whether your answers were correct. These exercises help you check your understanding and practice for the in-class nanoquiz, so take them seriously. Merely reading something is not as effective for learning as first reading and then testing yourself on what you read. Before-class work is generally due at 10pm the day before the class. Work done after that deadline earns partial credit: nearly full credit for work late by an hour or two, but less and less the longer overdue.

Nanoquizzes are graded like quizzes. The nanoquiz will be worth 1/3 of the classwork grade. Participation in the in-class activies and discussions will be worth 2/3 of the classwork grade

### Class makeup
We automatically drop the lowest 5 classwork grades. If you’re dissatisfied with any of your nanoquiz grades, however, you can earn back some of its lost points by doing a makeup. A makeup involves answering a few new questions related to the topic of the class (which are chosen randomly from a pool), and writing your own original multiple-choice question or prarie learn question for the topic.

Be sure you do a makeup for the right class. If you don’t like your nanoquiz grade for Class 2, then you should be submitting a makeup related to Class 2.

A good makeup submission can earn back 1/2 of the points lost on that quiz. For example, if your nanoquiz grade for that class was 6/10, then an excellent makeup brings your grade up to 8/10. If you missed the class entirely and got 0/10, then a makeup can raise it to at most 5/10. Makeups that don’t follow the directions or show little effort will earn no makeup credit.

The deadline for making up a class is one week (7 × 24 hours) after that class’s grades are posted. Makeups may not be revised or resubmitted. Only one submission per class will be considered.

Makeup submissions are reviewed regularly, but at low priority, by various staff members, and not necessarily in order of submission. After a makeup is accepted, your classwork grade will usually be updated within a couple weeks, but it may take longer.

### Submitting a makeup
Submit your makeup on the makeup submission form.

Accepted makeup questions may be used anonymously as ungraded review or makeup material in this or future semesters.


## Problem sets, iteration, and slack days
Problem sets. To consolidate your understanding of the ideas from class, you will do five problem sets, PS0 to PS4, involving both design and implementation work. Problem sets will be done individually. More info: collaboration on problem sets.

### Iteration:
Each problem set will have two submissions, alpha and beta. The alpha submission will be graded. The beta submission is due a few days after you receive feedback on alpha. You will be expected to do a revision on your solutions and write up an explanation of where you went wrong in your first solution. Then you will have to do a check-in with a staff member during office hours within 7 days of the beta submission deadline where you talk through your revision. If you received full marks on your alpha submission, you do not have to submit a written revision. However, you still need to complete a check-in within 7 days of the beta submission deadline. 

### Slack days:  
To give you some flexibility for periods of heavy workload, minor illness, absence from campus, and other unusual circumstances, you may request limited extensions on problem set deadlines, called slack days. Each slack day is a 24-hour extension on the deadline. You have a budget of 10 slack days for the entire semester, which you may apply to any combination of problem sets, on either the alpha deadline or beta deadline or both. You can use at most 2 slack days for a given deadline. 

You must request your extension before the problem set is due, by filling out this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecF--lKuSqtInVrBADSc2GpWehYstVcWRJ9zyHp_do9MkxMA/viewform?usp=pp_url)

Slack days are atomic; you can’t chop them up into slack hours or minutes. If you choose to use a slack day because you’re struggling with an assignment, go to bed and sleep, and get help in the morning. Seriously, that’s why the smallest unit is a day.

Slack days apply only to individual problem sets, not to team projects.

If you have used up your slack days or exceeded the 2-day limit for a single deadline, you will need an instructor’s permission for more extension, and your circumstances will have to be extreme to justify the special request.

## Projects and Quizzes
### Project
You will complete a final project, which will be in the form of a user proposal for instrument access to be submitted to a scientific user facility. Students will select a user facility of their choosing, and write a proposal investigating mechanical properties/deformation features/defects using available equipment. In this proposal you will describe a research plan that you would like to complete to understand deformation in a specific system. Projects will be graded on how well the proposed work addresses the hypothesis, and the feasibility of the experiment. Each student will complete an individual final project on a unique topic. (Adapted from Berkeley MSE 241 Syllabus). Students can work individually or with a partner

The assignment will include:
- written proposal
- 15 minute in-class presentation


## Grading
The relative contributions of the various elements to your grade are:

**Problem sets:** 70%. PS0 is worth 10%, and PS1-PS4 are each worth 15%. Check-ins for PS0-PS4 are worth 1% of each problem set grade and are required to receive any points back on revisions. 

**Final Project:** 20%.

**Classwork:** 10%. Reflects your continuous participation in the course. Determined by effort on before-class reading exercises, grade on nanoquizzes, and effort on in-class exercises.

Letter grades are determined at the end of the semester. The default cutoffs are: a final average of 90 and above is an A, 80 and above is a B, 70 and above is a C. These boundaries may be adjusted downwards if necessary because of the difficulty of the assignments, but the boundaries will never be adjusted upwards, so a final average of 90 is guaranteed to be an A. The boundary adjustment is done heuristically, and there are no grade quotas, no grade targets, and no centering of the class on a particular grade boundary.

You are not competing against one another for grades. Our goal is for everyone to deepen their learning. Every student is considered individually in the final grading meeting, judging from their entire performance in the course. A single bad mark in an otherwise consistent record will often be discounted.

### What are the grade cutoffs this semester? What letter grade do I have?
Letter grade cutoffs are determined only in the final grading meeting, and they are assigned only after individual consideration as described above.

### I have a problem with my grade on a problem set or quiz or other assignment, what should I do?
If the problem is an objective grader error, like adding points incorrectly or overlooking something that was clear in your answer, then you can make a private post on Piazza to ask for the correction. Direct your post to “Instructors” to make sure your question is visible to all staff, but mention the specific grader (if shown in the grade report; it isn’t always). Include a hyperlink to the grade report you are asking about.

For other grading issues, we ask you not to post on Piazza, and not to email or ask a TA or LA. Piazza is reserved for learning and problem solving, and TAs and LAs are trying to focus on helping people learn rather than being grade arbiters.

Instead, please bring your grading questions to an instructor’s office hours, which are shown on the course calendar.


## Course Culture (Adapted from the [Data100 course](https://ds100.org/fa22/syllabus/#course-culture))
We hope to foster an inclusive and safe learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, and GSIs—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect. Some of the responsibility for that lies with the staff, but a lot of it ultimately rests with you, the students.

### Be Aware of Your Actions
Bear in mind that diversity has many facets, some of which are not visible. Your classmates may have medical conditions (physical or mental), personal situations (financial, family, etc.), or interests that aren’t common to most students in the course. Another aspect of professionalism is avoiding comments that (likely unintentionally) put down colleagues for situations they cannot control. Bragging in open space that an assignment is easy or “crazy,” for example, can send subtle cues that discourage classmates who are dealing with issues that you can’t see. Please take care, so we can create a class in which all students feel supported and respected.

### Be Respectful
Beyond the slips that many of us make unintentionally are a host of behaviors that the course staff, department, and university do not tolerate. These are generally classified under the term harassment; sexual harassment is a specific form that is governed by federal laws known as Title IX.

UC Berkeley’s [Title IX website](https://ophd.berkeley.edu/) provides many resources for understanding the terms, procedures, and policies around harassment. Make sure you are aware enough of these issues to avoid crossing a line in your interactions with other students. For example, repeatedly asking another student out on a date after they have said no can cross this line.

Your reaction to this topic might be to laugh it off, or to make or think snide remarks about “political correctness” or jokes about consent or other things. You might think people just need to grow a thicker skin or learn to take a joke. This isn’t your decision to make. Research shows the consequences (emotional as well as physical) on people who experience harassment. When your behavior forces another student to focus on something other than their education, you have crossed a line. You have no right to take someone else’s education away from them.

### Communicate Issues with Course Staff
Professionalism and respect for diversity are not just matters between students; they also apply to how the course staff treat the students. The staff of this course will treat you in a way that respects our differences. However, despite our best efforts, we might slip up, hopefully inadvertently. If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by the staff or overall class dynamic, please feel free to talk to us about it. The instructors in particular welcome any comments or concerns regarding conduct of the course and the staff.

We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences and respects your identities and backgrounds (including race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, and more.) To help accomplish this:

- If your name and/or pronouns differ from those that appear in your official records, please let us know.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being affected by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be resources for you.
- We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it.
- While the course staff understands that improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are not enough to overcome systemic issues in academia such as racism, queerphobia, and other forms of discrimination and hatred, we also recognize the importance of DEI work.
    - The Office of Graduate Diversity [https://grad.berkeley.edu/graduate-diversity/](https://grad.berkeley.edu/graduate-diversity/). 
    - There’s also a great set of resources available at [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/grievances](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/grievances).
- If there are other resources you think we should list here, let us know!
<b>We take all complaints about unprofessional or discriminatory behavior seriously.</b>


## Q&A

### What is the best way to ask asynchronous questions?
The best way to reach the course staff outside of office hours and lectures is by submitting a private or public post on Piazza. We encourage students to post questions about course content on piazza so that students can learn from eachothers questions. However, if you specific solutions to assignments should only be posted privately to the course instructors.

### Why is the class structured the way it is?
This class is focused on providing background knowledge on deformation features in crystalline solids and practice implementing this knowledge into a constructive and critical research setting. We want to provide as many opportunities for practice and feedback as possible so that you can take on your own research project at the end of the class. That means we don’t want to spend class time on lectures, we want to spend it on discussions of research and relevant concepts as you will spend most of your time in graduate school.

### Why is attendance in class required?
Class meetings are all about practice and feedback. The individual, pair, and small group questions, exercises, and the discussions and feedback led by instructors, are a required component of the class.

Class is like swim/judo/math team practice: you don’t get good unless you show up, and practicing with others is a necessary complement to practicing alone.

### I was or will be absent from class for one of the following:
Athletic event
Interview
Travel
Brief sickness or medical problem
… or couldn’t participate because of a technical issue, what can I do?

You are automatically excused from up to five classes. The grade for the missed nanoquiz and in-class work will be recorded as 0, but the lowest 5 classwork grades are dropped. You can also make up classes for partial credit by following the procedure for makeups.

We expect everyone to have to miss class for a legitimate academic, personal, or health reason at some point during the semester: that’s why the lowest grades are dropped automatically.

### Why do I need to read the readings and complete the reading exercises the night before coming to class?
Reading the material before class prepares you to spend class time practicing the concepts and skills you’re learning. Reading in advance gives you time to think and ask questions, and repeated exposure to material spaced out over time improves learning.

See: [Spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect)

### Why does the class have nanoquizzes on topics before we practice them in class?
Nanoquizzes assess whether you did the reading and practiced with the reading exercises before coming to class, and they provide feedback to you on your comprehension. Nanoquizzes are themselves part of the practice we do in class: recalling information from the readings benefits learning more than just re-reading or re-hearing it.

See: [Testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)

### Are past nanoquizzes available?
No. However, reading exercises are often based on (or copied from) past nanoquiz questions.

## Additional Resources

The staff of the [UHS Counseling and Psychological Services](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/caps) (Tang Center, 2222 Bancroft Way; 510-642-9494; for after-hours support, please call the 24/7 line at 855-817-5667) provides confidential, brief counseling and crisis intervention to students with personal, academic and career stress. Services are provided by a multicultural group of professional counselors including psychologists, social workers, and advanced level trainees. All undergraduate and graduate students are eligible for CAPS services, regardless of insurance coverage.

To improve access for engineering students, a licensed psychologist from the Tang Center also holds walk-in appointments for confidential counseling in Bechtel Engineering Center 241 (check [here](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising-counseling) for schedule).

### For disability accommodations
The [Disabled Students’ Program](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/) (DSP, 260 César Chávez Student Center #4250; 510-642-0518) serves students with disabilities of all kinds, including mobility impairments, blind or low vision, deaf or hard of hearing; chronic illnesses (chronic pain, repetitive strain injuries, brain injuries, AIDS/HIV, cancer, etc.) psychological disabilities (bipolar disorder, severe anxiety or depression, etc.), Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Learning Disabilities. Services are individually designed and based on the specific needs of each student as identified by DSP’s Specialists. The Program’s official website includes information on DSP staff, UCB’s disabilities policy, application procedures, campus access guides for most university buildings, and portals for students and faculty.

We are committed to creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students. If you have specific accommodations needs, please reach out at the beginning of the semester. We will always work to accommodate your needs to ensure your success in this course. Your privacy will be respected, and all discussions will be confidential.
We will have a survey at the beginning of the semester where you can include any information on your accommodations. 


#### Accessibility to course content:
Suggestions you have about making this class more accessible for you, whether or not you have an official DSP accommodation letter, will potentially make it more accessible and inclusive for everyone. Think about how wheelchair ramps are useful to everyone, not just wheel chair users, including people with wheeled suitcases, baby strollers, bikes and skateboards. We in



### For solving a dispute
The [Ombudsperson for Students](https://sa.berkeley.edu/Ombuds) (Sproul Hall 102; 510-642-5754) provides a confidential service for students involved in a University-related problem (academic or administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsperson can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students’ contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsperson, are cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm.

The [Student Advocate’s Office](https://advocate.berkeley.edu/) (SAO) is an executive, non-partisan office of the ASUC. We offer free, confidential casework services and resources to any student(s) navigating issues with the University, including academic, conduct, financial aid, and grievance concerns. All support is centered around students and aims for an equity-based approach.

### For recovery from sexual harassment or sexual assault
The [Care Line](https://care.berkeley.edu/care-line/) (510-643-2005) is a 24/7, confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, securing urgent safety resources, and accompaniment to medical care or reporting.

### For social services
[Social Services](http://uhs.berkeley.edu/students/counseling/socialservices.shtml) provides confidential services and counseling to help students with managing problems that can emerge from illness such as financial, academic, legal, family concerns, and more. They specialize in helping students with pregnancy resources and referrals; alcohol/drug problems related to one’s own or a family member’s use; sexual assault/rape; relationship or other violence; and support for health concerns-new diagnoses or ongoing conditions. Social Services staff will assess a student’s immediate needs, work with the student to develop a plan to meet those needs, and facilitate arrangements with academic departments and advocate for the student with other campus offices and community agencies, as well as coordinate services within UHS

## Inspirations
This class was developed under the UC Berkeley "Preparing Future Faculty: Developing Courses through the Lens of Universal Design for Learning (Summer 2024) program". See the [Berkeley Graduate Division GSI Teaching & Resource Center website](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/workshops-seminars-institutes/) for similar workshops and seminars. In addition, I was inspired by several courses I took as a student that facilitated my learning including:
- [MIT's 6.031](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp22/)
- [UC Berkeley's Data 100](https://ds100.org/)
