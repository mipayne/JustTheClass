## About Mechanics of Material Defects

This course will guide you through the practical tools and background knowledge you will need as an experimentalist studying deformation features in crystalline materials, specifically those that are of interest in the deformation and mechanical properties of metals. This course puts particular focus on being able to connect illustrative models to how defects might look when observed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or transmission electron microscope (TEM). This is not a comprehensive overview of material defects, but is instead an overview of materials defects for a first-year PhD student who will be studying deformation features in crystal structures. <small> I like to think of this as a crash course that I wish I had as a first-year PhD student </small>

We will do a quick overview of crystallographic structures including the Bravais lattices and slip systems as well as Schmid factor and slip trace analysis. Then we will take a detailed look at dislocations: how they form, move, and how to characterize them (theoretically and with electron microscopy). Finally, we will move onto higher dimensional defects including stacking faults, twins, and kink bands. At the end of this course, you will be able to identify deformation features based on electron microscope micrographs and supporting crystallographic information. Students will practice identification through journal club assignments where they will have to re-analyze data presented in papers and outline why the papers conclusions are justified or not given the available data.

### Learning Objectives
- Interpret unidentified defect structures in SEM and TEM micrographs
- Develop plans to determine which deformation features are present
- Evaluate claims that a paper makes about what deformation features are present
- Identify slip trace directions in an SEM image
- Classify a boundary as a grain boundary, kink band, or twin
- Determine if a dislocation is edge or screw
- Use a burgers circuit to find the burgers vector
- Relate deformation features to observed mechanical properties
- Predict mechanical behavior based on observed deformation features

## Classes, readings, nanoquizzes
### Class meetings
There will be two 1-hour class meetings each week on Tuesday and Thursday. You are expected to attend all class meetings and to participate actively in exercises and discussions
### Readings
Most classes will have a reading that you must read before coming to class, with online exercises that you should do by 10pm the night before the class. The online exercises are designed to be practice for the in-class nanoquizzes, but are not graded for correctness, only for effort. 
### Nanoquizzes 
Every class meeting will begin with a short quiz on the required reading for the class, plus recent class meetings. Nanoquizzes are closed-book and closed-notes, with a 3-minute time limit. The nanoquiz is part of the grade for each class, along with reading exercises, in-class discussion, and other activities.

The lowest 5 classwork grades are automatically dropped, so you are automatically excused from up to five classes. You can also make up missed or low classwork grades. More info: details of classwork grading and makeup.

## Classwork Grading and Makeup

Each class meeting has a classwork grade out of 10 points, which combines:
exercises before class (e.g. reading questions), a nanoquiz at the start of class, and in-class discussions. You will be asked to set three participation goals for this class and your self assessment towards your goals will factor into your final classwork grade. 

Before-class work is graded based on whether you put effort into it, not whether your answers were correct. These exercises help you check your understanding and practice for the in-class nanoquiz, so take them seriously. Merely reading something is not as effective for learning as first reading and then testing yourself on what you read. Before-class work is generally due at 10pm the day before the class. Work done after that deadline earns partial credit: nearly full credit for work late by an hour or two, but less and less the longer overdue.

Nanoquizzes are graded like quizzes. The nanoquiz will be worth roughly from 1/3 to 2/3 of the classwork grade, but possibly less than 1/3. The exact amount will vary from class to class, depending on the number and kind of other activities.

### Class makeup
We automatically drop the lowest 5 classwork grades. If you’re dissatisfied with any of your classwork grades, however, you can earn back some of its lost points by doing a makeup. A makeup involves answering a few new questions related to the topic of the class (which are chosen randomly from a pool), and writing your own original multiple-choice question for the topic.

Be sure you do a makeup for the right class. If you don’t like your grade for Class 2, then you should be submitting a makeup related to Class 2.

A good makeup submission can earn back 1/2 of the classwork points lost on that class. For example, if your classwork grade for that class was 6/10, then an excellent makeup brings your grade up to 8/10. If you missed the class entirely and got 0/10, then a makeup can raise it to at most 5/10. Makeups that don’t follow the directions or show little effort will earn no makeup credit.

The deadline for making up a class is one week (7 × 24 hours) after that class’s grades are posted. Makeups may not be revised or resubmitted. Only one submission per class will be considered.

Makeup submissions are reviewed regularly, but at low priority, by various staff members, and not necessarily in order of submission. After a makeup is accepted, your classwork grade will usually be updated within a couple weeks, but it may take longer.

### Submitting a makeup
Submit your makeup on the makeup submission form.

Accepted makeup questions may be used anonymously as ungraded review or makeup material in this or future semesters.

## Q&A
#### Why is the class structured the way it is?
This class is focused on providing background knowledge on deformation features in crystalline solids and practice implementing this knowledge into a constructive and critical research setting. We want to provide as many opportunities for practice and feedback as possible so that you can take on your own research project at the end of the class. That means we don’t want to spend class time on lectures, we want to spend it on discussions of research and relevant concepts as you will spend most of your time in graduate school.

#### Why is attendance in class required?
Class meetings are all about practice and feedback. The individual, pair, and small group questions, exercises, and the discussions and feedback led by instructors, are a required component of the class.

Class is like swim/judo/math team practice: you don’t get good unless you show up, and practicing with others is a necessary complement to practicing alone.

#### I was or will be absent from class for one of the following:
Athletic event
Interview
Travel
Brief sickness or medical problem
… or couldn’t participate because of a technical issue, what can I do?

You are automatically excused from up to five classes. The grade for the missed nanoquiz and in-class work will be recorded as 0, but the lowest 5 classwork grades are dropped. You can also make up classes for partial credit by following the procedure for makeups.

We expect everyone to have to miss class for a legitimate academic, personal, or health reason at some point during the semester: that’s why the lowest grades are dropped automatically.

#### Why do I need to read the readings and complete the reading exercises the night before coming to class?
Reading the material before class prepares you to spend class time practicing the concepts and skills you’re learning. Reading in advance gives you time to think and ask questions, and repeated exposure to material spaced out over time improves learning.

See: [Spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect)

#### Why does the class have nanoquizzes on topics before we practice them in class?
Nanoquizzes assess whether you did the reading and practiced with the reading exercises before coming to class, and they provide feedback to you on your comprehension. Nanoquizzes are themselves part of the practice we do in class: recalling information from the readings benefits learning more than just re-reading or re-hearing it.

See: [Testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)

#### Are past nanoquizzes available?
No. However, reading exercises are often based on (or copied from) past nanoquiz questions.

## Problem sets, iteration, and slack days
Problem sets. To consolidate your understanding of the ideas from class, you will do five problem sets, PS0 to PS4, involving both design and implementation work. Problem sets will be done individually. More info: collaboration on problem sets.

Iteration:
Each problem set will have two submissions, alpha and beta. The alpha submission will be graded. The beta submission is due a few days after you receive feedback on alpha. You will be expected to do a revision on your solutions and write up an explanation of where you went wrong in your first solution. Then you will have to do a check-in with a staff member during office hours within 7 days of the beta submission deadline where you talk through your revision. If you received full marks on your assignment you will be asked to complete an alternate media assignment. See more about alternate media assignments [here]().

Slack days. To give you some flexibility for periods of heavy workload, minor illness, absence from campus, and other unusual circumstances, you may request limited extensions on problem set deadlines, called slack days. Each slack day is a 24-hour extension on the deadline. You have a budget of 10 slack days for the entire semester, which you may apply to any combination of problem sets, on either the alpha deadline or beta deadline or both. You can use at most 2 slack days for a given deadline. 

You must request your extension before the problem set is due, by filling out this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecF--lKuSqtInVrBADSc2GpWehYstVcWRJ9zyHp_do9MkxMA/viewform?usp=pp_url)

Slack days are atomic; you can’t chop them up into slack hours or minutes. If you choose to use a slack day because you’re struggling with an assignment, go to bed and sleep, and get help in the morning. Seriously, that’s why the smallest unit is a day.

Slack days apply only to individual problem sets, not to team projects.

If you have used up your slack days or exceeded the 2-day limit for a single deadline, you will need an instructor’s permission for more extension, and your circumstances will have to be extreme to justify the special request.

## Projects and Quizzes
### Project
You will complete a final project, which will be in the form of a user proposal for instrument access to be submitted to a scientific user facility. Students will selecte a user facility of their choosing, and write a proposal investigating mechanical properties/deformation features/defects using available equipment. In this proposal you will describe a research plan that you would like to complete to understand deformation in a specific system. Projects will be graded on how well the proposed work addresses the hypothesis, and the feasibility of the experiment. Each student will complete an individual final project on
a unique topic. (Adapted from Berkeley MSE 241 Syllabus)


## Grading
The relative contributions of the various elements to your grade are:

Problem sets: 64%. PS0 is worth 8%, and PS1-PS4 are each worth 14%.
Final Project: 20%.
Classwork: 10%. Reflects your continuous participation in the course. Determined by effort on before-class reading exercises, grade on nanoquizzes, and effort on in-class exercises.
Letter grades are determined at the end of the semester. The default cutoffs are: a final average of 90 and above is an A, 80 and above is a B, 70 and above is a C. These boundaries may be adjusted downwards if necessary because of the difficulty of the assignments, but the boundaries will never be adjusted upwards, so a final average of 90 is guaranteed to be an A. The boundary adjustment is done heuristically, and there are no grade quotas, no grade targets, and no centering of the class on a particular grade boundary.

Every student is considered individually in the final grading meeting, judging from their entire performance in the course. A single bad mark in an otherwise consistent record will often be discounted.

### What are the grade cutoffs this semester? What letter grade do I have?
Letter grade cutoffs are determined only in the final grading meeting, and they are assigned only after individual consideration as described above.

### I have a problem with my grade on a problem set or quiz or other assignment, what should I do?
If the problem is an objective grader error, like adding points incorrectly or overlooking something that was clear in your answer, then you can make a private post on Piazza to ask for the correction. Direct your post to “Instructors” to make sure your question is visible to all staff, but mention the specific grader (if shown in the grade report; it isn’t always). Include a hyperlink to the grade report you are asking about.

For other grading issues, we ask you not to post on Piazza, and not to email or ask a TA or LA. Piazza is reserved for learning and problem solving, and TAs and LAs are trying to focus on helping people learn rather than being grade arbiters.

Instead, please bring your grading questions to an instructor’s office hours, which are shown on the course calendar.


## Inspirations
This class was developed under the UC Berkeley "Preparing Future Faculty: Developing Courses through the Lens of Universal Design for Learning (Summer 2024) program". See the [Berkeley Graduate Division GSI Teaching & Resource Center website](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/workshops-seminars-institutes/) for similar workshops and seminars. In addition, I was inspired by several courses I took as a student that facilitated my learning including:
- [MIT's 6.031](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp22/)
- [UC Berkeley's Data 100](https://ds100.org/)
