# Introduction to Lomer-Cotrell Locks and Stacking Fault Tetrahedra


# Lesson Plan:


## Learning Objectives:
- Students will be able to describe how planes move to create stacking faults

## Lesson

## Nanoquiz (10 min)
Students are expected to arrive on time so that they have enought time to complete the nanoquiz.
### Question 1
What angle do the sides of a Lomer Cottrell lock make? Why?

Answer: 70?

### Question 2
Why would a stacking fault tetrahedra make such triangular patterns?

Answer: Intersection of three 111 slip planes that happen to intersect at a point?


## Mini Lecture (25 min)
Today will be a more in-depth lecture of the math behind lomer-cottrell locks and stacking fault tetrahedra. We will write out the vectors for how they form.

## Activity \# 1 (12 min total including debrief)
