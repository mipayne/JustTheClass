# Learning Objectives of Unit 3: Stacking Faults

## Identify
- <u>Identify</u> a stacking fault with through TEM micrographs
- <u>Identify</u> a Lomer Cottrell lock through TEM micrographs
- <u>Identify</u> a stacking fault tetrahedra through TEM micrographs

By being able to identify these features in TEM micrographs, you will have a tool in your toolbox to accomplish several overall learning objectives including:
  - <u>Develop</u> plans to determine which deformation features are present
  - <u>Evaluate</u> claims that a paper makes about what deformation features are present

## Describe
- <u>Describe</u> how planes move to create a stacking fault
- <u>Describe</u> how dislocations relate to stacking faults

In knowing how to describe what a stacking fault is in relation to planes and dislocations, you will have a fundamental understanding of how the feature forms and what needs to happen to form it. This fundamental understanding will help you in the future to:

  - <u>Develop</u> plans to determine which deformation features are present
  - <u>Relate</u> deformation features to observed mechanical properties

## Explain
- <u>Explain</u> how stacking faults affect mechanical properties

If you can explain how stacking faults affect mechanical properties in a general sense, then for specific scenarios you can:

  - <u>Relate</u> deformation features to observed mechanical properties
  - <u>Predict</u> mechanical behavior based on observed deformation features

Ultimately these skills help materials scientists understand how things will deform and either implement them in safe ways or design new materials with improved behavior.

## Calculate
- <u>Calculate</u> Stacking fault energy

By calculating the stacking fault energy you will have a tool to:
  - <u>Relate</u> deformation features to observed mechanical properties
