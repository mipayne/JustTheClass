# Learning Objectives of Unit 3: Stacking Faults

## Identification
- <u>Identify</u> a stacking fault with through TEM micrographs
- Identify a Lomer Cottrell lock through TEM micrographs
- Identify a stacking fault tetrahedra through TEM micrographs
By being able to identify these features in TEM micrographs you will have a tool in your toolbox accomplish several overall learning objectives including:
  - Develop plans to determine which deformation features are present
  - Evaluate claims that a paper makes about what deformation features are present
## Describe
- Describe how planes move to create a stacking fault
- Describe how dislocations relate to stacking faults
In knowing how to describe what a stacking fault is in relation to planes and dislocations you will have a fundamental understanding of how the feature forms and what needs to happen to form it. This fundamental understanding will help you in the future to
  - Develop plans to determine which deformation features are present
  - Relate deformation features to observed mechanical properties
## Explain
- Explain how stacking faults affect mechanical properties
If you can explain how stacking faults affect mechanical properties in a general sense, then for specific scenarios you can
  - Relate deformation features to observed mechanical properties
  - Predict mechanical behavior based on observed deformation features
Ultimately these skills help materials scientists understand how things will deform and either implement them in safe ways or design new materials with improved behavior.

## Calculate
- Calculate Stacking fault energy
By calculating the stacking fault energy you will have a tool to 
  - Relate deformation features to observed mechanical properties
