# Topics
Lecture 6: Introduction to dislocations
- Movement and interaction of dislocations (e.g. climb, crossslip, kinking)
- Equations of dislocations (only around 5 slides worth of content in traditional class style)
	- dislocation strain fields

Lecture 7: Characterization/Imaging of dislocations
- TEM - G.b
- SEM - ECCI
- STEM imaging BF and DF
- Lacbed: further reading slides but will not provide lot of information

Lecture 8: Dislocations and Deformation
- misfit dislocations
- GND's/all the things I read for the Cu project
In this section we will go over the connection between dislocations and deformation
- what do dislocations tell you about deformation
- wavy vs planar slip?
