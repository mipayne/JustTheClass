# Topics

The goal of this section is to give students the basic overivew of SEM and TEM to provide the necessary context for imaging and characterization encountered in the rest of the course.

Lecture 04: Basics of SEM
- Secondary electron diffraction, backscatter diffraction
- EDS
- EBSD
How does crystal structures we discussed last unit relate to what we can see in SEM?
What basic knowledge of SEM do we need for further units?

Lecture 05: Basics of TEM: Part 1
- focus on TEM
- HRTEM

Lecture 06: Basics of TEM: Part 2
- focus on STEM
- Spectroscopy:
	- STEM EDS
	- EELS
- HRSTEM
