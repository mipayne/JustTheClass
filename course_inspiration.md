Defects in Solids UCB MSE 205 course description:
Many properties of solid state materials are determined by lattice defects. This course treats in detail the structure of crystal defects, defect formation and annihilation processes, and the influence of lattice defects on the physical and optical properties of crystalline materials.

MSE256A UC Irvine: Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials

 This course will cover the microscopic mechanisms that control the mechanical behavior of materials. Plasticity, creep, shear banding, and fracture will be addressed through a discussion of how such behavior is measured and modeled. Subjects to be covered include dislocation theory, strengthening mechanisms, high temperature diffusion and grain boundary sliding, shear localization, void formation, ductile rupture, and brittle fracture.
