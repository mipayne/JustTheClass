# Mechanics of Material Defects

This course will guide you through the practical tools and background knowledge you will need as an experimentalist studying deformation features in crystalline materials, specifically those that are of interest in the deformation and mechanical properties of metals. This course puts particular focus on being able to connect illustrative models to how defects might look when observed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or transmission electron microscope (TEM). This is not a comprehensive overview of material defects, but is instead an overview of materials defects for a first-year PhD student who will be studying deformation features in crystal structures. <small> I like to think of this as a crash course that I wish I had as a first-year PhD student </small>
